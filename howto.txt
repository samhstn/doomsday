# Weekdays as numbers

We must learn to map weekdays to numbers and visa versa.

The following days are mapped to the following numbers.

```
Sunday <-> 0
Monday <-> 1
Tuesday <-> 2
Wednesday <-> 3
Thursday <-> 4
Friday <-> 5
Saturday <-> 6
```

# Anchor days

We must learn which "anchor day" is associated with each year.

Calendars repeat themselves every 400 years, it wouldn't be too difficult
to work out the "anchor day" of other years.

```
1800 - 1899 -> Friday <-> 5
1900 - 1999 -> Wednesday <-> 3
2000 - 2099 -> Tuesday <-> 2
2100 - 2199 -> Sunday <-> 6
```

# Doomsday

There are six steps to calculate the doomsday for any given year.

We will use Februrary, 1978 as an example.

1. How many times does 12 fit into the last 2 digits of the year?
12 * 6 = 72, so the result is **6**.

2. What is the remainder of the above calculation multiplied by 12?
78 - 12 * 6 = 6, so the result is **6**.

3. How many times does the number 4 fit into the result of calculation 2?
4 fits in to 6 1 time, so the result is **1**.

4. What is the anchor day?
1900 - 1999 -> Wednesday <-> 3, so the result is **3**.

5. Add up the results of steps 1-4
6 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 16, so the result is **16**.

6. What is the remainder when we subtract the largest multiple of 7 from the result of step 5?
16 - 14 = 2. So the result is **2**.

# Doomsday days for each month

We now need to learn which day the doomsday falls on for each month.

Remember the doomsday will repeat every 7 days.

January:
If we are in a leap year, 4, otherwise 3
February:
Always the last day in the month, so 29 for leap years, otherwise 28
March:
Pi Day is always a Doomsday, 14th March, so 14 (or 0 or 7).
April, June, August, October, December:
These even months simply map to 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
May, July, September, November:
These can be remembered by the mnemonic: I work 9-5 at the 7-11.
May is the 5th Month and has doomsday 9
July is the 7th Month and has doomsday 11
September is the 9th Month and has doomsday 5
November is the 9th Month and has doomsday 7

So, for our example of 10th February, 1978, our year has a doomsday of 2 <-> Tuesday.
We know that the last day in February is a Doomday. We know that 1978 isn't a leap year.
So, the Doomsday will fall on 0th, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th.
We know that 7th is a Tuesday, 10th is 3 days later, so we arrive on our answer: **Friday**
We could follow a more algorithmic approach, which would give us:

(Calculated Doomsday + Day of week - Doomsday for year) mod 7

= (2 + 10 - 28) mod 7

= 40 mod 7

= 5 <-> Friday
